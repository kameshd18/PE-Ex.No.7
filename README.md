**Date:**  
**Register No.: 212222240043**  

---

## Aim  
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT – to demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.  

---

## AI Tools Required  
- OpenAI ChatGPT (Large Language Model)  
- Prompt Engineering Techniques  
- (Optional) Python/Java CLI for simulation  

---

## Explanation  
A prompt-based application uses carefully designed instructions to interact with a Large Language Model (LLM).  

Here, we design a **Personal Productivity Assistant** that helps in:  
- Managing daily tasks  
- Scheduling reminders and detecting overlaps  
- Suggesting wellness tips  
- Answering general queries  
- Adapting to user’s personal preferences over time  

This application fosters creativity and improves practical problem-solving skills by tailoring AI tools to real-life needs.

## Prompt Used  

Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks,
schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries.
The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable
to the user’s changing preferences over time.

## Procedure  

1. Define Core Requirements  
   - Daily Task Manager  
   - Smart Scheduler  
   - Wellness Tips Generator  
   - Query Answering Module  
   - Preference Adaptation (optional memory)  

2. Identify & Construct Prompts  
   - For task management:  
     "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM."  
   - For scheduling:  
     "Schedule a study session from 4 PM to 6 PM."  
   - For wellness:  
     "Suggest a short activity after 2 hours of screen time."  
   - For queries:  
     "What is the capital of Japan?"  

3. Simulate Interaction  
   - User interacts via a simple CLI/chat interface.  
   - Prompts are processed by the LLM.  

4. Adaptation  
   - Collect user feedback (e.g., prefers meditation instead of walking).  
   - Modify assistant’s future responses accordingly.

## Expected Output  

### Personal Productivity Assistant Features  

- **Daily Task Manager:**  
  - Accepts tasks in natural language.  
  - Organizes tasks by priority and deadlines.  
  - Provides daily summaries of pending items.  

- **Smart Scheduler:**  
  - Schedules events and reminders.  
  - Detects overlapping appointments.  
  - Suggests free time slots.  

- **Wellness Tips Generator:**  
  - Provides daily health and productivity advice.  
  - Adapts suggestions based on past user preferences.  

- **General Query Answering:**  
  - Responds to common knowledge questions naturally.

### Example LLM Responses  

User: Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.
Assistant: Got it! I’ll remind you to call mom at 6 PM today.

User: Schedule a meeting tomorrow from 3 to 4 PM.
Assistant: Meeting scheduled. No overlaps detected.

User: Suggest a wellness tip.
Assistant: Drink a glass of water and take a short 5-min walk to refresh.

User: I prefer meditation over walking.
Assistant: Noted! I’ll suggest meditation for your breaks from now on.

User: What is the capital of Japan?
Assistant: The capital of Japan is Tokyo.

## Result  
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept of a personal productivity assistant powered by large language models.  

Students were able to:  
- Understand how to tailor LLM prompts for real-life use.  
- Foster creativity by designing personalized features.  
- Learn prompt engineering techniques for better interaction.  
- Experience the utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
